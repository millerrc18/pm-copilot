# Production Dashboard

The Production dashboard summarizes shop orders and operations. Use it to understand what is late, what is in progress, and which work centers are busy.

## Views

- Orders view groups shop orders by status and due date.
- Operations view lists sequence level activity from the Shop Order Operations report.

## Status mapping

Statuses are taken from the IFS export. If a status is not recognized, it appears as provided in the import file.
