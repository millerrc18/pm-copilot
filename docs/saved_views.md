# Saved Views

Saved views let you store filter selections as defaults for each Operations dashboard. When you return to a page, the saved view applies automatically.

## How it works

- Apply filters on a dashboard.
- Select Save as default to store the view.
- Use Reset saved view to clear the defaults.

Saved views are per user and per dashboard.
