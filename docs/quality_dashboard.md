# Quality Dashboard

Quality combines scrap and MRB imports to show cost of poor quality. The pareto chart highlights the biggest defect reasons.

## Key metrics

- Scrap cost total for the selected period
- MRB open count, based on status values not marked closed
- Top defect reason and top part by scrap cost

## Tips

- Use reason code filters to isolate the highest impact defects.
- Use disposition filters to track MRB outcomes like rework or scrap.
