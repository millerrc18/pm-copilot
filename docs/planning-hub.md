# Planning hub

The Planning Hub will centralize early-stage planning tasks so teams can move from proposal to delivery without losing context.

## Planned capabilities

- Build bid/proposal schedules with key milestones.
- Assign resources and track availability by role.
- Align budgets with planned delivery phases.

**Status:** Coming soon. Initial planning templates are being drafted.
