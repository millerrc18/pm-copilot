# Planning hub

The Planning Hub consolidates contract, milestone, and delivery unit timelines into a single view.

## What you can do

- Filter the timeline by program or item type.
- Review contract windows alongside milestone due dates and shipment activity.
- Edit contract, milestone, or delivery unit details from the timeline view.

## Tips

- Use the program filter to focus on a single delivery stream.
- Keep milestone quantities current to avoid surprises in delivery reviews.
