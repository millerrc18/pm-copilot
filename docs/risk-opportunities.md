# Risk & Opportunities tracker

The upcoming Risk & Opportunities tracker will help PMs log issues and upside opportunities in one place, alongside delivery and cost data.

## What the tracker will include

- A register to log risks and opportunities with clear descriptions.
- Assignment of owners and due dates.
- Likelihood and impact scoring to prioritize mitigation.
- A mitigation log to capture actions taken and results.

**Status:** Coming soon. We are validating workflows with early users.
