# Proposals, quotes, and bidding

This module will track active proposals, pricing assumptions, and bid status before work enters delivery.

## Initial experience

- Start in the [Proposals module](/proposals) to review sample bids.
- A proposal list with stages (draft, submitted, won, lost).
- A lightweight **New proposal** form to capture scope and pricing assumptions.
- Links to transition a proposal into a program and contract.

**Status:** Coming soon. Prototype layouts are in design.
