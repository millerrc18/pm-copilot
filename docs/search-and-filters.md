# Search and filters

Use the global search bar to locate programs, contracts, and documentation in one place.

## Global search

1. Use the search bar in the top navigation or sidebar.
2. Enter a keyword such as a program name, contract code, or topic.
3. Review results across **Programs**, **Contracts**, and **Documentation**.

## Program filters

On the Programs list, combine search with status filters to narrow results quickly. Recommended filters include:

- **Active** vs **Archived** programs
- **Customer** name
- **Upcoming milestones**

## Tips for better search results

- Use short keywords like "contract" or "milestone".
- Combine a customer name + fiscal year.
- For documentation, search for verbs like "import" or "delete".
