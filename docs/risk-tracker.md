# Risk tracker

The risk tracker will give PMs a dedicated space to log delivery risks, track ownership, and monitor mitigation progress.

## Planned workflow

- Capture risk statements with an owner and target date.
- Score likelihood and impact to prioritize mitigation work.
- Review trendlines alongside milestone performance.

**Status:** Coming soon. Prototype views are in progress.
