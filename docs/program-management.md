3. Add the program name, customer name, and key dates.
4. Save to open the program overview.

## Edit program details

1. Open the program overview.
2. Select **Edit program**.
3. Update the fields you need (name, customer, timeline).
4. Save changes.

## Delete or retire a program

1. Open the program overview.
2. Select **Delete program**.
3. Confirm the deletion.

> Tip: If you need to preserve historical data, export reports before deleting a program.

## Review program performance

Use the dashboard tiles to track revenue, cost, and delivery health. See [Dashboard metrics](/docs/dashboard-metrics) for definitions.
For time-based cost analysis, use the [Cost Hub](/docs/cost-tracking).

## Connect contracts and imports

- Add contracts using the [Contract management guide](/docs/contract-management).
- Import cost, milestone, or delivery unit data from the [Imports](/docs/import-costs) guides.
