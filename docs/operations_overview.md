## What you can do

- Review material spend and supplier concentration in Procurement.
- Track shop orders and operations flow in Production.
- Compare planned versus actual labor in Efficiency.
- Monitor scrap cost and MRB volume in Quality.
- Explore BOM structure and where used relationships in BOM Explorer.

## Getting started

1. Visit Operations Imports and download the template for the report you need.
2. Export the matching report from IFS and align headers with the template.
3. Upload the file, then open the relevant dashboard for the program.
