# BOM Explorer

BOM Explorer helps you navigate multi-level bills of material. Use the tree view for structure, flattened view for rollups, and where used to find parent assemblies.

## Views

- Tree: indented view by level.
- Flattened: rollup quantity per component.
- Where used: parent assemblies for a component.

## Tips

- Set a parent part to limit tree and flattened results.
- Use component part filters for where used searches.
