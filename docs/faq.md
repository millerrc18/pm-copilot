# Frequently asked questions

## How do I reset my password?

Use the **Forgot password** link on the sign-in page. An email will be sent to your company account.

## Why can't I import my file?

Common causes:

- Missing required columns (see the import guides).
- Date formats not using `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Contract codes that do not match existing contracts.

## Can I delete a program or contract?

Yes. Use the **Delete** actions on the program or contract page. Deleting removes related data, so export reports if you need a historical snapshot.

## Where can I learn about dashboard metrics?

See the [Dashboard metrics guide](/docs/dashboard-metrics) for full definitions.

## Who do I contact for support?

Reach out to your internal PM Copilot administrator or the product team in your workspace.
